The following machine learning codes can only run if the previous ones were run before hand (libraries, fitted models, etc.):

- Machine Learning Day1
- Machine Learning Day2
- Machine Learning Day3
- Decision Trees

(None of the above code related to ML is in the repo so far (Aug 2023) because I can't get the lecture code to work and thus knit)
