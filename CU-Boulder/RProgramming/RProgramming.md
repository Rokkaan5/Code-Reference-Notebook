# CU Boulder - Statistical Programming in R
(essentially my introduction to R programming in general)

## Lecture notes:
Some of the code might be broken depending on if it's pre-class or post-class codes. 
And some of the codes didn't have html files made yet, and I haven't taken the time to create them again.

(So might need to fix later)

The following machine learning codes can only run if the previous ones were run before hand (libraries, fitted models, etc.):
- Machine Learning Day1
- Machine Learning Day2
- Machine Learning Day3
- Decision Trees
