# Homework

Any parts of any of the hw that contained coding portions

## HW1
- [HW1 - Question 3: Binomial and Poisson Distributions](HW/hw1/hw1.html)
    - Mainly just comparing Binomial vs. Poisson Distribution 
        -(like their difference when *p* is not small enough)

## HW2
- [HW2](HW/hw2/hw2-clean.html)
    1. Binomial and Gaussian Distributions
        - Compare Binomial vs. Poisson vs. Gaussian
    2. How Old is This Volcano?
        - Age estimation based on count rate example
        - Posterior probability (Bayes law)
            - using Poisson as parent distribution
        - various versions of sigma calculations
            - simple
            - distribution
            - FWHM
    3. Random Wak and Central Limit Theorem
        - Drunk walk example
            - Compare Binomial and Gaussian
            - Drunk walk with slopes
                - bottom of valley
                - top hill
    4. Not So Random Walk: Power Law
        - Step size changes based on location
