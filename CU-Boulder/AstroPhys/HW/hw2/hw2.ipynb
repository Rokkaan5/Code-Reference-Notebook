The goal of this problem is to show how a Gaussian distribution is a good approximation of a Poisson or binomial distribution at high expected counts ($\\lambda$ or $\\mu$). Furthermore, a Gaussian distribution is continuous whereas the Poisson and binomial distributions can be difficult to evaluate via computer at high $n$. \n",

The other issue is that the probability distributions are often not symmetric, which creates a bit of a conundrum. It is natural to choose the most likely value of $P(t;x)$ as the age of the volcano but one can see that there is a greater probability that the volcano is older than the likely age rather than younger (if your plot is correct at this point). So how does one determine the uncertainty?\n",

What does the does this method yield $[t_{min},t_{max}]$? You now have calculated sigma three times. Is there a significant difference between them? (More to come on this!)"
