Intensified CCDs have been a popular choice for imaging far-away or faint objects particularly in the UV as they can count individual photons. No longer do readout noise, dark currents, biases, and pixel gain dominate the uncertainty. But there is a price to pay: the point spread is increased and another uncertainty is added.\n",
