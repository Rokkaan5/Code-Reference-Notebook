# [CU Boulder](../../CUB.qmd): [Neural Networks](NeuralNets.qmd)
(Fall 2023) Neural Networks with Dr. Ami Gates at CU Boulder

# HW Submissions by Module

These are my homework submissions, so all my code. As much as possible done "from scratch" by myself. (But there are chances I got some help from Dr. Gates' above code examples.)

## Module 1

- [Assignment 1 (Jupyter Notebook)](HW/hw1/A1_JasmineKobayashi.ipynb)
    - [Simple OOP of Logistic Regression (for this HW)](HW/hw1/hw1_log_reg_code.qmd)

## Module 2

- Assignment 2 - Part 1: One Layer NN with One Output
- Assignment 2 - Part 2: Multinomial NN with Softmax, CCE, and One-Hot Encoding

## Module 3
