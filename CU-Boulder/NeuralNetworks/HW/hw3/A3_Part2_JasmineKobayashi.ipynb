    "Use the Fashion MNIST Digits dataset again here. This time, create a CNN in TF/Keras. Just like in Part 1, you will have Python code and you will create a Word Doc that fully illustrates your model, outcomes, data, accuracies, vis, etc.\n",

    "# Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `Sequential` Model\n",
    "- Have at elast (more is fine) two `Conv2D` layers with all the needed parameters, shapes, number of filters, and activation.\n",
    "- Have at least two `MaxPooling` layers\n",
    "- You will need at least one `Flatten` Layer and one `Dense` Layer.\n",
    "- Use the appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics.\n",
    "- Illustrate your raw data, at least one image of what your training data looks like as a matrix and as an image. (The matrix may be large - so you can make it small or use a portion of it). Illustrate data sizes so that I know that you know the sizes of your training data, your testing data, etc.\n",
    "- Include the first two and last two epoch runs.\n",
    "- Include a visualization for the Loss over all epochs.\n",
    "- Include a confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals here are to learn to use Keras to build a CNN Model to learn and then predict image data. It is also important to understand shapes and sizes of images, filters, etc. As you do this, make sure that you understand what you are coding and that you illustrate it (on the Word Doc) for the reader to see what you did and confirm that you know what you did :).\n"
