    "For this part, you can choose any dataset you like. I recommend choosing text data (such as movie reviews: <https://keras.io/api/datasets/imdb/>) and predicting sentiment. However, I will allow you to select any sequential dataset you like as long as it is appropriate for RNNs.\n",

    "Just as in Parts 1 and 2 (I will not repeat the requirements again here - but please assume them) you will illustrate your process and results. You will also discuss and illustrate a comparison between the RNN and the LSTM models.\n"
