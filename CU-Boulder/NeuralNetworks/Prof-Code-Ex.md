# [CU Boulder](../../CUB.md): [Neural Networks](NeuralNets.md)
(Fall 2023) Neural Networks with Dr. Ami Gates at CU Boulder

## Dr. Gates' Code Examples

Most (if not all) code made availabe through her own [website](https://gatesboltonanalytics.com/)

- Reference: Professor Ami Gates, Dept. Applied Math, Data Science, University of Colorado
- All pages of raw-code = unedited code as obtained from Dr. Gates' website
- All markdown versions = versions of Dr. Gates' code cleaned up into a notebook or markdown of somesort (Jupyter or Quarto) edited by me (Jasmine) to show code output, etc.

# Module 1

- Simple NN using just Sklearn ([Raw code](raw_code/NN_Just_sklearn_Gates.html); [Markdown](mrkdwn/NN_Just_sklearn_Gates.html))
- Logistic Regression ([Raw code](raw_code/LogReg_gates.html); [Markdown](mrkdwn/LogReg_gates.html))
    - Using gradient descent
    - Updating $\mathbf{w}$ and with GD and LR
    - Using the Loss Function LCE: Cross Entropy
    - Using the Sigmoid as the logistic activation
    - Vis

# Module 2

- Using FF and BP to Train a NN to predict XOR ([Raw code](raw_code/XOR_NN.html); (markdown not made yet))
- Using FF and BP - NN - 3D Data - Binary Label ([Raw code](raw_code/Mod2_3D_binary.html); (markdown not made yet))
- Using FF, BP, Softmax, CCE, One-Hot Encoding, etc. ([Raw code](raw_code/Multinomial_NN.html); (markdown not made yet))

## Extra Resources

- Softmax, CCE, and One-Hot Encoding - 3 Outputs ([Raw code](raw_code/Extra-3Outputs.html))
