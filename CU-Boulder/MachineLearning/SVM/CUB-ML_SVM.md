# [CU Boulder](../../../CUB.md): [Machine Learning](../CUB-ML.md) - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Most (if not all) code made availabe through her own [website](https://gatesboltonanalytics.com/)

- Reference: Professor Ami Gates, Dept. Applied Math, Data Science, University of Colorado
- All pages of raw-code = unedited code as obtained from Dr. Gates' website
- All markdown versions = versions of Dr. Gates' code cleaned up into a notebook or markdown of somesort (Jupyter or Quarto) edited by me (Jasmine) to show code output, etc.

**(only code is in Python)**

- Single code example ([Raw](../DecisionTrees/Raw/Python-DecisionTrees-Raw.html)): This code includes Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, a lot of vis, and several other examples. 
    - [Part 1 - Markdown](../DecisionTrees/Markdown/Python-DecisionTrees.html#svm): Text mining example
    - [Part 2 - Markdown](../DecisionTrees/Markdown/Python-DecisionTrees-pt2.html#svm): Mixed/Numeric Record data example
