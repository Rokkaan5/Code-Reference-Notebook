# [CU Boulder: Machine Learning](../CUB-ML.qmd) - Association Rule Mining (ARM)
Most (if not all) code made availabe through her own [website](https://gatesboltonanalytics.com/)

- Reference: Professor Ami Gates, Dept. Applied Math, Data Science, University of Colorado
- All pages of raw-code = unedited code as obtained from Dr. Gates' website
- All markdown versions = versions of Dr. Gates' code cleaned up into a notebook or markdown of somesort (Jupyter or Quarto) edited by me (Jasmine) to show code output, etc.

**(only code is in R)**

Prof Gate's ARM code in R provides examples of ARM applications
- apriori algorithms
- creating interactive visualization of ARM rules
