[Spring 2023] ***Machine Learning*** with Dr. Ami Gates at [CU Boulder](../../CUB.md)

---

Most (if not all) code made availabe through [Professor Gates' website](https://gatesboltonanalytics.com/)

- Reference: Professor Ami Gates, Dept. Applied Math, Data Science, University of Colorado
- All pages of raw-code = unedited code as obtained from Dr. Gates' website
- All markdown versions = versions of Dr. Gates' code cleaned up into a notebook or markdown of somesort (Jupyter or Quarto) edited by me (Jasmine) to show code output, etc.
