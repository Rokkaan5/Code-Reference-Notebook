# Agile Software Development
## Agile Manifesto
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value: 

- **Individuals & interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
