I agree with that point because of my experience in the research assistant position. Another one of the main reasons why I decided to pursue a grad education in Data Science was because I had fun exploring the different effects of using (training) data made with different preprocessing methods (which evaluated by evaluating the feature importance and other aspects of the model I built). I experimented with different feature selections and normalizing vs. not normalizing the data. And each training set had different effects on the model's structure and performance.
