# [CU Boulder](../../CUB.md): [Data Mining](DataMining.md) - Assignment Submissions
(Spring 2023) Data Mining with Professor Di Wu at CU Boulder

These are all my homework and exam submissions.

## HW 1 
(Associated with [Data Collection/Integration](Lectures.md#01-data-integration) lecture section)

- [Part A - Reasoning](Assignments/HW1/PartA-Reasoning.html)
    - What do you understand by the term "Data Mining"?
    - {Example scenario with CU dining service business model} 
        - What would you do as a Data Miner? Explain the methods of Data collection in this case.
    - List out the challenges or difficulties in Data Collection. How would you mine huge data?
- [Part B - Application](Assignments/HW1/PartB-Application.html)
    - Data collection "tutorial" for job search in STEM
    - Webscraping application of news data for sentimental analysis
        - (I never finished this part (yet))
- [Part C - Reading](Assignments/HW1/PartC-Reading.html)
    - **Paper title:** *Security and Privacy Issues of Big Data*


## HW 2
(Associated with [Data Manipulation](Lectures.md#02-data-manipulation) & [Data Understanding](Lectures.md#03-data-understanding) lecture section)

- [Part A - Reasoning](Assignments/HW2/PartA-Reasoning.html)
    - What is the step "Data Understanding" in statistics, in the Data Mining Pipeline? Why do we need it?
    - What are the measures of central tendency (Ms)? Explain the relevance of each of them with suitable examples.
    - What are the measures of dispersion? Explain the relevance of each of them with suitable examples.
    - What are the measures of similarity? Explain the relevance of each of them with suitable examples.
    - (Optional question) {given an example scenario and dataset} What statistical test would you perform (t-test or z-test) to check the problem statement?
        - (I never answered)
- [Part B - Application](Assignments/HW2/PartB-Application.html)
    - Job-seeking dataset
        - Apply the Python `pandas` package to the data and demonstrate how we can use it to get a better understanding of the data.
    - News data
        - Perform text processing. Label the data as "positive"/"negative" sentiments
            - (I never finished this part)
- [Part C - Reading](Assignments/HW2/PartC-Reading.html)
    - **Paper title:** *Exploratory Data Analysis*

- [Part A - Reasoning](Assignments/HW3/PartA-Reasoning.html)
    - What do you mean by a normal distribution of data? What happens when the data is not normally distributed? Explain with an example.
    - How is a quantile-quantile plot different from a quantile plot? Illustrate with an example.
    - Identify plot types 
- [Part B - Application](Assignments/HW3/PartB-Application.html)
    - Data visualization application to `fatalities` dataset
