    - What is the step "Data Understanding" in statistics, in the Data Mining Pipeline? Why do we need it?
    - What are the measures of central tendency (Ms)? Explain the relevance of each of them with suitable examples.
    - What are the measures of dispersion? Explain the relevance of each of them with suitable examples.
    - What are the measures of similarity? Explain the relevance of each of them with suitable examples.
    - (Optional question) {given an example scenario and dataset} What statistical test would you perform (t-test or z-test) to check the problem statement?
        - (I never answered)
- [Part B - Application](Assignments/HW2/PartB-Application.html)
    - Job-seeking dataset
        - Apply the Python `pandas` package to the data and demonstrate how we can use it to get a better understanding of the data.
    - News data
        - Perform text processing. Label the data as "positive"/"negative" sentiments
            - (I never finished this part)

- [Part A - Reasoning](Assignments/HW5/PartA-Reasoning.html)
    - Discuss the big picture of learning and why we have both supervised and unsupervised learning
    - Someone claims that the "Nearest Neighbor" method is not a learning method. Do you agree or disagree, and why?
