## [CU Boulder: Machine Learning](../CUB-ML.md) - Decision Trees
Most (if not all) code made availabe through her own [website](https://gatesboltonanalytics.com/)
- Reference: Professor Ami Gates, Dept. Applied Math, Data Science, University of Colorado
- All pages of raw-code = unedited code as obtained from Dr. Gates' website
- All markdown versions = versions of Dr. Gates' code cleaned up into a notebook or markdown of somesort (Jupyter or Quarto) edited by me (Jasmine) to show code output, etc.

### in R
- Example 1 ([Markdown](Markdown/R-DecisionTrees-Ex1.html), [Raw](Raw/R-DecisionTrees-Ex1-Raw.md)): Decision Trees in R using labeled record data - and visualizations
- Example 2 (Markdown, [Raw](Raw/R-DecisionTrees-Ex2-Raw.md)): Decision Trees for text data in R and visualizations
- Example 3 (Markdown, [Raw](Raw/R-DecisionTrees-Ex3-Raw.md)): Decision Trees for mixed data types (clean record data and numeric text corpus)

### Python
"The following Python code is for several ML methods including Decision Trees and Vis. If the vis prints poorly, save it as a file." - Gates Website

- Single code example ([Raw](Raw/Python-DecisionTrees-Raw.md)): This code includes Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, a lot of vis, and several other examples.
    - [Part 1 - Markdown](Markdown/Python-DecisionTrees.html): Text mining example
    - [Part 2 - Markdown](Markdown/Python-DecisionTrees-pt2.html): Mixed/Numeric Record data example
