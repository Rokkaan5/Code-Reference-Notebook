## [CU Boulder: Machine Learning](../CUB-ML.md) - 
Most (if not all) code made availabe through her own [website](https://gatesboltonanalytics.com/)
- Reference: Professor Ami Gates, Dept. Applied Math, Data Science, University of Colorado
- All pages of raw-code = unedited code as obtained from Dr. Gates' website
- All markdown versions = versions of Dr. Gates' code cleaned up into a notebook or markdown of somesort (Jupyter or Quarto) edited by me (Jasmine) to show code output, etc.

### in R
- Single code ([Markdown](Markdown/R-NaiveBayes.html), [Raw](Raw/R-NaiveBayes-Raw.md)): Naive Bayes (etc) in R for Text dat and for Record Data. Text will be corpus.

### Python

- Single code example (Markdown, [Raw](../DecisionTrees/Raw/Python-DecisionTrees-Raw.md)): This code includes Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, a lot of vis, and several other examples. (same as Decision Tree code (I think))
    - [Part 1 - Markdown](../DecisionTrees/Markdown/Python-DecisionTrees.html): Text mining example
    - [Part 2 - Markdown](../DecisionTrees/Markdown/Python-DecisionTrees-pt2.html): Mixed/Numeric Record data example

- Extra code (Markdown, [Raw](Raw/Python-NB-Extra-Raw.md)):
