## [CU Boulder: Machine Learning](../CUB-ML.md) - Clustering
Most (if not all) code made availabe through her own [website](https://gatesboltonanalytics.com/)
- Reference: Professor Ami Gates, Dept. Applied Math, Data Science, University of Colorado
- All pages of raw-code = unedited code as obtained from Dr. Gates' website
- All markdown versions = versions of Dr. Gates' code cleaned up into a notebook or markdown of somesort (Jupyter or Quarto) edited by me (Jasmine) to show code output, etc.

### in R
