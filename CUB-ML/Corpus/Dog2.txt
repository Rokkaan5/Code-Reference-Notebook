A cat is different than a dog. A cat does not run and jump as much, but rather they sleep a lot. in fairness, a dog can also sleep a lot. but unlike dog, you can do lots of playing with a cat while you sit on the couch. but if you have an intruder in your home, it is probably better to have a dog, since felines will usually just run under the bed and hide.
