Most (if not all) code made availabe through her own [website](https://gatesboltonanalytics.com/))
## Data Preprocessing (Cleaning, EDA, Visualizations)

(Not all codes made available yet on her site - 3/14/2023)
- APIs
    - in Python
    - in R

- Preparing Labelled Data
    - in Python
    - in R
- Data Visualization
    - in Python
    - in R

## [Clustering](Clustering/CUB-ML_Clustering.md)

### in R

**Clustering-ex1.R**: Comprehensive Clustering Tutorial

**Clustering-ex2.R** = Document similarity

**Clustering-ex3.R** = Text Mining and NLP Tutorial

### Python

GatesClustering1.py = Clustering with data obtained from API

GatesClustering2.py = Clustering using various data types (corpus directory, and csv's)

## [Association Rule Mining](ARM/CUB-ML_ARM.md)

(only one code)

Prof Gate's ARM code in R provides examples of ARM applications
- apriori algorithms
- creating interactive figures
