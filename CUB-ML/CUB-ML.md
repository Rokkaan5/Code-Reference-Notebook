# Machine Learning
(Spring 2023) Machine learning with Dr. Ami Gates (most (if not all) code made availabe through her own [website](https://gatesboltonanalytics.com/))

## Clustering

### in R
(Raw code files in GitHub Repo)

**Clustering-ex1.R**: Comprehensive Clustering Tutorial

- [Markdown html of Clustering-ex1](CUB-ML/clust-ex1-mkdn.html)

- Partitional and hierarchical clustering using csv and corpus txt file data.

**Clustering-ex2.R** = Document similarity

**Clustering-ex3.R** = Text Mining and NLP Tutorial

### Python

GatesClustering1.py = Clustering with data obtained from API

GatesClustering2.py = Clustering using various data types (corpus directory, and csv's)

- [Jupyter html of Clustering example-2 (python) code](CUB-ML/Clust2.html)

## Association Rule Mining

Prof Gate's ARM code in R provides examples of ARM applications, apriori algorithms, and creating interactive figures
