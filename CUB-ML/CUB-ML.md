# [CU Boulder](../CUB.md): Machine Learning
(Spring 2023) Machine learning with Dr. Ami Gates at CU Boulder

Most (if not all) code made availabe through her own [website](https://gatesboltonanalytics.com/)
- Reference: Professor Ami Gates, Dept. Applied Math, Data Science, University of Colorado
- All pages of raw-code = unedited code as obtained from Dr. Gates' website
- All markdown versions = versions of Dr. Gates' code cleaned up into a notebook or markdown of somesort (Jupyter or Quarto) edited by me (Jasmine) to show code output, etc.

## Data Preprocessing (Cleaning, EDA, Visualizations)

(Not all codes made available yet on her site - 3/14/2023)
- APIs
    - in Python
    - in R

- Preparing Labelled Data
    - in Python
    - in R
- Data Visualization
    - in Python
    - in R

## [Clustering](Clustering/CUB-ML_Clustering.md)

### in R

- Example 1: Comprehensive Clustering Tutorial
- Example 2: Document similarity
- Example 3: Text Mining and NLP Tutorial

### in Python

- Code 1: Clustering with data obtained from API
- Code 2: Clustering using various data types (corpus directory, and csv's)

## [Association Rule Mining](ARM/CUB-ML_ARM.md)

(only one code - in R)

Prof Gate's ARM code in R provides examples of ARM applications
- apriori algorithms
- creating interactive figures

## [Decision Trees](DecisionTrees/CUB-ML_DT.md)
### in R
- Example 1 : Decision Trees in R using labeled record data - and visualizations
- Example 2 : Decision Trees for text data in R and visualizations
- Example 3 : Decision Trees for mixed data types (clean record data and numeric text corpus)

### in Python
- Single code example : This code includes Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, a lot of vis, and several other examples.

## Naive Bayes
