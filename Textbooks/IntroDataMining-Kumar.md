# Kumar "Introduction to Data Mining" textbook
There is a textbook called "Introduction to Data Mining" by Kumar, et. al (2nd edition). 

[webpage for 2nd edition](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php)

The page also includes some tutorial notebooks/code to supplement some of the chapters. 

## Python Jupyter notebook tutorials
Webpage to view and download all of the python tutorial code and data <http://www.cse.msu.edu/~ptan/dmbook/software/>. There's a way to view the notebooks as html pages on the webpage directly. 

The links below are the same exact notebooks I re-rendered through Quarto to include the table of contents on the pages. Otherwise, I made NO other changes to the notebooks and are otherwise identical to the code available for download on the textbook webpage (so all credit belongs to them). 

- [Introduction to Numpy and Pandas](Textbooks/IntroDataMining-Kumar/tutorial2.html)
- [Data Exploration](Textbooks/IntroDataMining-Kumar/tutorial3.html)
- [Data Preprocessing](Textbooks/IntroDataMining-Kumar/tutorial4.html)
- [Regression](Textbooks/IntroDataMining-Kumar/tutorial5.html)
- [Classification](Textbooks/IntroDataMining-Kumar/tutorial6.html)
- Association analysis (there wasn't anything to download on the page when I last visited (March 2023))
- [Cluster Analysis](Textbooks/IntroDataMining-Kumar/tutorial8.html)
- [Anomaly Detection](Textbooks/IntroDataMining-Kumar/tutorial9.html)

## R-code

The main "R-code examples" page (with some links to slides , as well as example code by Michael Hahsler): <https://mhahsler.github.io/Introduction_to_Data_Mining_R_Examples/> 

All the example code is collected into this online book "*An R Companion for Introduction to Data Mining*": <https://mhahsler.github.io/Introduction_to_Data_Mining_R_Examples/book/index.html>
