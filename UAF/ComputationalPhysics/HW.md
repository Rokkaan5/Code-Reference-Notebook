# HW Submissions

The following are all *my* submissions to the HW assignments when I was taking the class in Spring 2020. But many are incomplete, incorrect, or the code could just generally be more improved/efficient/DRY; so it would be cool to try to go back and finish/fix/improve/generally try them again.

- [**HW1:** Taylor Series](HW/HW1.html)
- [**HW2:** Parabolic Trajectories](HW/HW2.html)
- [**HW3:** Mass on a Spring](HW/HW3.html)
- [**HW4:** Method of Least Squares](HW/HW4.html)
- [**HW5:** 4th-Order Runge-Kutta (rk4)](HW/HW5.html)
- [**HW6:** Lagrange Interpolation](HW/HW6.html)
- [**HW7:** Numerical Integration](HW/HW7.html)
- [**HW8:** Fourier Analysis](HW/HW8.html)
