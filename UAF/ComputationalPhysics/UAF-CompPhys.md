# Labs
The following are all *my* submissions to the lab assignments when I was taking the class in Spring 2020. But many are incomplete, incorrect, or the code could just generally be more improved/efficient/DRY; so it would be cool to try to go back and finish/fix/improve/generally try them again.

## Lab Solutions
[Lab 6: (Nonlinear lab) answer](Lab-Solutions/Delamere_Lab6a.html) (Which I got from Hunter when he had the class)

# Wilberforce Pendulum Project


Code file 1:

- [Jupyter Run-Through](Wilberforce/Wilberforce.html)
- [Raw Code](WilberforceProject.md)

Check GitHub repo for python code files for my Wilberforce pendulum animation project

Includes example uses of RK4 and matplotlib.animation
