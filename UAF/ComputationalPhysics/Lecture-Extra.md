# Lecture Extras

Some code from Dr. Delamere to supplement the lectures

## [Cooling](Lecture-Extra/Cooling.html)

- Math & code examples for Newton's law of cooling

## [Array Syntax](Lecture-Extra/Array_syntax.html)

- Mainly just some examples and "tutorials" to learn more about Python's array syntax

## [Random Numbers](Lecture-Extra/Random_numbers.html)

- Notebook example to learn more about random number generation in Python

## [2D Monte Carlo](Lecture-Extra/2D_Monte_Carlo.html)

- Example for Multidimensional Monte Carlo Integration

## Fourier Transform

(I don't have the code for it, but if look in combined lecture notes, I can probably recreate it myself from scratch)

## Uncertainty Principle

(I don't have the code for it, but if look in combined lecture notes, I can probably recreate it myself from scratch)

## Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

(I don't have the code for it, but if look in combined lecture notes, I can probably recreate it myself from scratch)

## Molecular Dynamics

(I don't have the code for it, but if look in combined lecture notes, I can probably recreate it myself from scratch)

## Gaussian Quadrature

(I don't have the code for it, but if look in combined lecture notes, I can probably recreate it myself from scratch)

## Systems of Equations

(I don't have the code for it, but if look in combined lecture notes, I can probably recreate it myself from scratch)
